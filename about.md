No Joke Scala is a blog with useful solutions for problems that are hard too google.
I share some design patterns and good practices I found useful during my work.


## About me
I am a backend Scala developer working with [Play!][50853056] on a daily basis.
I work in a small and effective team at [Evojam](evojam.com) where we create
scalable web applications using REST microservices.
