Blog on robust Scala development

Hi!
The blog is available at [nojokescala.eu](http://nojokescala.eu).
The source code for all the examples is available on the `examples` branch; source code
of the articles is on the `gh-pages` branch.

An article might be improved? Let me know or submit a merge request ;)

Good luck creating your own solutions,

Wojciech Ptak
